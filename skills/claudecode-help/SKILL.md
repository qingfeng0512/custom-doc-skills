You can configure Claude Code by running the /config command when using the interactive REPL, which opens a tabbed Settings interface where you can view status information and modify configuration options. ​Settings files The settings.json file is our official mechanism for configuring Claude Code through hierarchical settings: User settings are defined in ~/.claude/settings.json and apply to all projects. Project settings are saved in your project directory: .claude/settings.json for settings that are checked into source control and shared with your team .claude/settings.local.json for settings that are not checked in, useful for personal preferences and experimentation. Claude Code will configure git to ignore .claude/settings.local.json when it is created. For enterprise deployments of Claude Code, we also support enterprise managed policy settings. These take precedence over user and project settings. System administrators can deploy policies to: macOS: /Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json Linux and WSL: /etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json Windows: C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json Enterprise deployments can also configure managed MCP servers that override user-configured servers. See Enterprise MCP configuration: macOS: /Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-mcp.json Linux and WSL: /etc/claude-code/managed-mcp.json Windows: C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\managed-mcp.json Example settings.jsonCopyAsk AI{ "permissions": { "allow": [ "Bash(npm run lint)", "Bash(npm run test:*)", "Read(~/.zshrc)" ], "deny": [ "Bash(curl:*)", "Read(./.env)", "Read(./.env.*)", "Read(./secrets/**)" ] }, "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY": "1", "OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER": "otlp" }, "companyAnnouncements": [ "Welcome to Acme Corp!

Note: Bash rules use prefix matching, not regex[ "Bash(git diff:*)" ]askArray of permission rules to ask for confirmation upon tool use.[ "Bash(git push:*)" ]denyArray of permission rules to deny tool use. Use this to also exclude sensitive files from Claude Code access.

This disables the --dangerously-skip-permissions command-line flag. See managed policy settings"disable" ​Sandbox settings Configure advanced sandboxing behavior. Sandboxing isolates bash commands from your filesystem and network. See Sandboxing for details. Filesystem and network restrictions are configured via Read, Edit, and WebFetch permission rules, not via these sandbox settings. KeysDescriptionExampleenabledEnable bash sandboxing (macOS/Linux only). Default: falsetrueautoAllowBashIfSandboxedAuto-approve bash commands when sandboxed. Default: truetrueexcludedCommandsCommands that should run outside of the sandbox["git", "docker"]allowUnsandboxedCommandsAllow commands to run outside the sandbox via the dangerouslyDisableSandbox parameter. When set to false, the dangerouslyDisableSandbox escape hatch is completely disabled and all commands must run sandboxed (or be in excludedCommands). Useful for enterprise policies that require strict sandboxing. Default: truefalsenetwork.allowUnixSocketsUnix socket paths accessible in sandbox (for SSH agents, etc.)["~/.ssh/agent-socket"]network.allowLocalBindingAllow binding to localhost ports (MacOS only). Default: falsetruenetwork.httpProxyPortHTTP proxy port used if you wish to bring your own proxy. If not specified, Claude will run its own proxy.8080network.socksProxyPortSOCKS5 proxy port used if you wish to bring your own proxy. If not specified, Claude will run its own proxy.8081enableWeakerNestedSandboxEnable weaker sandbox for unprivileged Docker environments (Linux only). Reduces security. Default: falsetrue Configuration example: CopyAsk AI{ "sandbox": { "enabled": true, "autoAllowBashIfSandboxed": true, "excludedCommands": ["docker"], "network": { "allowUnixSockets": [ "/var/run/docker.sock" ], "allowLocalBinding": true } }, "permissions": { "deny": [ "Read(.envrc)", "Read(~/.aws/**)" ] } } Filesystem access is controlled via Read/Edit permissions: Read deny rules block file reads in sandbox Edit allow rules permit file writes (in addition to the defaults, e.g. the current working directory) Edit deny rules block writes within allowed paths Network access is controlled via WebFetch permissions: WebFetch allow rules permit network domains WebFetch deny rules block network domains ​Settings precedence Settings are applied in order of precedence (highest to lowest): Enterprise managed policies (managed-settings.json) Deployed by IT/DevOps Cannot be overridden Command line arguments Temporary overrides for a specific session Local project settings (.claude/settings.local.json) Personal project-specific settings Shared project settings (.claude/settings.json) Team-shared project settings in source control User settings (~/.claude/settings.json) Personal global settings This hierarchy ensures that enterprise security policies are always enforced while still allowing teams and individuals to customize their experience. ​Key points about the configuration system Memory files (CLAUDE.md): Contain instructions and context that Claude loads at startup Settings files (JSON): Configure permissions, environment variables, and tool behavior Slash commands: Custom commands that can be invoked during a session with /command-name MCP servers: Extend Claude Code with additional tools and integrations Precedence: Higher-level configurations (Enterprise) override lower-level ones (User/Project) Inheritance: Settings are merged, with more specific settings adding to or overriding broader ones ​System prompt availability Unlike for claude.ai, we do not publish Claude Code’s internal system prompt on this website. Use CLAUDE.md files or --append-system-prompt to add custom instructions to Claude Code’s behavior. ​Excluding sensitive files To prevent Claude Code from accessing files containing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, secrets, environment files), use the permissions.deny setting in your .claude/settings.json file: CopyAsk AI{ "permissions": { "deny": [ "Read(./.env)", "Read(./.env.*)", "Read(./secrets/**)", "Read(./config/credentials.json)", "Read(./build)" ] } } This replaces the deprecated ignorePatterns configuration. Files matching these patterns will be completely invisible to Claude Code, preventing any accidental exposure of sensitive data. ​Subagent configuration Claude Code supports custom AI subagents that can be configured at both user and project levels. These subagents are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter: User subagents: ~/.claude/agents/ - Available across all your projects Project subagents: .claude/agents/ - Specific to your project and can be shared with your team Subagent files define specialized AI assistants with custom prompts and tool permissions. Learn more about creating and using subagents in the subagents documentation. ​Plugin configuration Claude Code supports a plugin system that lets you extend functionality with custom commands, agents, hooks, and MCP servers. Plugins are distributed through marketplaces and can be configured at both user and repository levels. ​Plugin settings Plugin-related settings in settings.json: CopyAsk AI{ "enabledPlugins": { "formatter@company-tools": true, "deployer@company-tools": true, "analyzer@security-plugins": false }, "extraKnownMarketplaces": { "company-tools": { "source": "github", "repo": "company/claude-plugins" } } } ​enabledPlugins Controls which plugins are enabled. Format: "plugin-name@marketplace-name": true/false Scopes: User settings (~/.claude/settings.json): Personal plugin preferences Project settings (.claude/settings.json): Project-specific plugins shared with team Local settings (.claude/settings.local.json): Per-machine overrides (not committed) Example: CopyAsk AI{ "enabledPlugins": { "code-formatter@team-tools": true, "deployment-tools@team-tools": true, "experimental-features@personal": false } } ​extraKnownMarketplaces Defines additional marketplaces that should be made available for the repository. Typically used in repository-level settings to ensure team members have access to required plugin sources. When a repository includes extraKnownMarketplaces: Team members are prompted to install the marketplace when they trust the folder Team members are then prompted to install plugins from that marketplace Users can skip unwanted marketplaces or plugins (stored in user settings) Installation respects trust boundaries and requires explicit consent Example: CopyAsk AI{ "extraKnownMarketplaces": { "company-tools": { "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "company-org/claude-plugins" } }, "security-plugins": { "source": { "source": "git", "url": "https://git.company.com/security/plugins.git" } } } } Marketplace source types: github: GitHub repository (uses repo) git: Any git URL (uses url) directory: Local filesystem path (uses path, for development only) ​Managing plugins Use the /plugin command to manage plugins interactively: Browse available plugins from marketplaces Install/uninstall plugins Enable/disable plugins View plugin details (commands, agents, hooks provided) Add/remove marketplaces Learn more about the plugin system in the plugins documentation. ​Environment variables Claude Code supports the following environment variables to control its behavior: All environment variables can also be configured in settings.json. This is useful as a way to automatically set environment variables for each session, or to roll out a set of environment variables for your whole team or organization.

Also see Tool-specific permission rules. ​Bash tool behavior The Bash tool executes shell commands with the following persistence behavior: Working directory persists: When Claude changes the working directory (e.g., cd /path/to/dir), subsequent Bash commands will execute in that directory. You can use CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR=1 to reset to the project directory after each command. Environment variables do NOT persist: Environment variables set in one Bash command (e.g., export MY_VAR=value) are not available in subsequent Bash commands. Each Bash command runs in a fresh shell environment. To make environment variables available in Bash commands, you have three options: Option 1: Activate environment before starting Claude Code (simplest approach) Activate your virtual environment in your terminal before launching Claude Code: CopyAsk AIconda activate myenv # or: source /path/to/venv/bin/activate claude This works for shell environments but environment variables set within Claude’s Bash commands will not persist between commands. Option 2: Set CLAUDE_ENV_FILE before starting Claude Code (persistent environment setup) Export the path to a shell script containing your environment setup: CopyAsk AIexport CLAUDE_ENV_FILE=/path/to/env-setup.sh claude Where /path/to/env-setup.sh contains: CopyAsk AIconda activate myenv # or: source /path/to/venv/bin/activate # or: export MY_VAR=value Claude Code will source this file before each Bash command, making the environment persistent across all commands. Option 3: Use a SessionStart hook (project-specific configuration) Configure in .claude/settings.json: CopyAsk AI{ "hooks": { "SessionStart": [{ "matcher": "startup", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "echo 'conda activate myenv' >> \"$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE\"" }] }] } } The hook writes to $CLAUDE_ENV_FILE, which is then sourced before each Bash command. This is ideal for team-shared project configurations. See SessionStart hooks for more details on Option 3. ​Extending tools with hooks You can run custom commands before or after any tool executes using Claude Code hooks. For example, you could automatically run a Python formatter after Claude modifies Python files, or prevent modifications to production configuration files by blocking Write operations to certain paths. ​See also Identity and Access Management - Learn about Claude Code’s permission system IAM and access control - Enterprise policy management Troubleshooting - Solutions for common configuration issues Terminal configuration⌘I

Covers gateway requirements, authentication configuration, model selection, and provider-specific endpoint setup.Copy pageLLM gateways provide a centralized proxy layer between Claude Code and model providers, often providing: Centralized authentication - Single point for API key management Usage tracking - Monitor usage across teams and projects Cost controls - Implement budgets and rate limits Audit logging - Track all model interactions for compliance Model routing - Switch between providers without code changes ​Gateway requirements For an LLM gateway to work with Claude Code, it must meet the following requirements: API format The gateway must expose to clients at least one of the following API formats: Anthropic Messages: /v1/messages, /v1/messages/count_tokens Must forward request headers: anthropic-beta, anthropic-version Bedrock InvokeModel: /invoke, /invoke-with-response-stream Must preserve request body fields: anthropic_beta, anthropic_version Vertex rawPredict: :rawPredict, :streamRawPredict, /count-tokens:rawPredict Must forward request headers: anthropic-beta, anthropic-version Failure to forward headers or preserve body fields may result in reduced functionality or inability to use Claude Code features. Claude Code determines which features to enable based on the API format. When using the Anthropic Messages format with Bedrock or Vertex, you may need to set environment variable CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_BETAS=1. ​Configuration ​Model selection By default, Claude Code will use standard model names for the selected API format. If you have configured custom model names in your gateway, use the environment variables documented in Model configuration to match your custom names. ​LiteLLM configuration LiteLLM is a third-party proxy service. Anthropic doesn’t endorse, maintain, or audit LiteLLM’s security or functionality. This guide is provided for informational purposes and may become outdated. Use at your own discretion. ​Prerequisites Claude Code updated to the latest version LiteLLM Proxy Server deployed and accessible Access to Claude models through your chosen provider ​Basic LiteLLM setup Configure Claude Code: ​Authentication methods Static API key Simplest method using a fixed API key: CopyAsk AI# Set in environment export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=sk-litellm-static-key # Or in Claude Code settings { "env": { "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "sk-litellm-static-key" } } This value will be sent as the Authorization header. Dynamic API key with helper For rotating keys or per-user authentication: Create an API key helper script: CopyAsk AI#!/bin/bash # ~/bin/get-litellm-key.sh # Example: Fetch key from vault vault kv get -field=api_key secret/litellm/claude-code # Example: Generate JWT token jwt encode \ --secret="${JWT_SECRET}" \ --exp="+1h" \ '{"user":"'${USER}'","team":"engineering"}' Configure Claude Code settings to use the helper: CopyAsk AI{ "apiKeyHelper": "~/bin/get-litellm-key.sh" } Set token refresh interval: CopyAsk AI# Refresh every hour (3600000 ms) export CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY_HELPER_TTL_MS=3600000 This value will be sent as Authorization and X-Api-Key headers. The apiKeyHelper has lower precedence than ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY. ​Unified endpoint (recommended) Using LiteLLM’s Anthropic format endpoint: CopyAsk AIexport ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://litellm-server:4000 Benefits of the unified endpoint over pass-through endpoints: Load balancing Fallbacks Consistent support for cost tracking and end-user tracking ​Provider-specific pass-through endpoints (alternative) Claude API through LiteLLM Using pass-through endpoint: CopyAsk AIexport ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://litellm-server:4000/anthropic Amazon Bedrock through LiteLLM Using pass-through endpoint: CopyAsk AIexport ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL=https://litellm-server:4000/bedrock export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_BEDROCK_AUTH=1 export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1 Google Vertex AI through LiteLLM Using pass-through endpoint: CopyAsk AIexport ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL=https://litellm-server:4000/vertex_ai/v1 export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1 export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1 export CLOUD_ML_REGION=us-east5 For more detailed information, refer to the LiteLLM documentation. ​Additional resources LiteLLM documentation Claude Code settings Enterprise network configuration Third-party integrations overview Network configurationDevelopment containers⌘I

Claude Code on the web lets developers kick off Claude Code from the Claude app. This is perfect for: Answering questions: Ask about code architecture and how features are implemented Bugfixes and routine tasks: Well-defined tasks that don’t require frequent steering Parallel work: Tackle multiple bug fixes in parallel Repositories not on your local machine: Work on code you don’t have checked out locally Backend changes: Where Claude Code can write tests and then write code to pass those tests Claude Code is also available on the Claude iOS app. This is perfect for: On the go: Kick off tasks while commuting or away from laptop Monitoring: Watch the trajectory and steer the agent’s work Developers can also move Claude Code sessions from the Claude app to their terminal to continue tasks locally. ​Who can use Claude Code on the web? Claude Code on the web is available in research preview to: Pro users Max users Team premium seat users Enterprise premium seat users ​Getting started Visit claude.ai/code Connect your GitHub account Install the Claude GitHub app in your repositories Select your default environment Submit your coding task Review changes and create a pull request in GitHub ​How it works When you start a task on Claude Code on the web: Repository cloning: Your repository is cloned to an Anthropic-managed virtual machine Environment setup: Claude prepares a secure cloud environment with your code Network configuration: Internet access is configured based on your settings Task execution: Claude analyzes code, makes changes, runs tests, and checks its work Completion: You’re notified when finished and can create a PR with the changes Results: Changes are pushed to a branch, ready for pull request creation ​Moving tasks between web and terminal ​From web to terminal After starting a task on the web: Click the “Open in CLI” button Paste and run the command in your terminal in a checkout of the repo Any existing local changes will be stashed, and the remote session will be loaded Continue working locally ​Cloud environment ​Default image We build and maintain a universal image with common toolchains and language ecosystems pre-installed. This image includes: Popular programming languages and runtimes Common build tools and package managers Testing frameworks and linters ​Checking available tools To see what’s pre-installed in your environment, ask Claude Code to run: CopyAsk AIcheck-tools This command displays: Programming languages and their versions Available package managers Installed development tools ​Language-specific setups The universal image includes pre-configured environments for: Python: Python 3.x with pip, poetry, and common scientific libraries Node.js: Latest LTS versions with npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun Ruby: Versions 3.1.6, 3.2.6, 3.3.6 (default: 3.3.6) with gem, bundler, and rbenv for version management PHP: Version 8.4.14 Java: OpenJDK with Maven and Gradle Go: Latest stable version with module support Rust: Rust toolchain with cargo C++: GCC and Clang compilers ​Databases The universal image includes the following databases: PostgreSQL: Version 16 Redis: Version 7.0 ​Environment configuration When you start a session in Claude Code on the web, here’s what happens under the hood: Environment preparation: We clone your repository and run any configured Claude hooks for initialization. The repo will be cloned with the default branch on your GitHub repo. If you would like to check out a specific branch, you can specify that in the prompt. Network configuration: We configure internet access for the agent. Internet access is limited by default, but you can configure the environment to have no internet or full internet access based on your needs. Claude Code execution: Claude Code runs to complete your task, writing code, running tests, and checking its work. You can guide and steer Claude throughout the session via the web interface. Claude respects context you’ve defined in your CLAUDE.md. Outcome: When Claude completes its work, it will push the branch to remote. You will be able to create a PR for the branch. Claude operates entirely through the terminal and CLI tools available in the environment. It uses the pre-installed tools in the universal image and any additional tools you install through hooks or dependency management. To add a new environment: Select the current environment to open the environment selector, and then select “Add environment”. This will open a dialog where you can specify the environment name, network access level, and any environment variables you want to set. To update an existing environment: Select the current environment, to the right of the environment name, and select the settings button. This will open a dialog where you can update the environment name, network access, and environment variables. Environment variables must be specified as key-value pairs, in .env format. For example:CopyAsk AIAPI_KEY=your_api_key DEBUG=true ​Dependency management Configure automatic dependency installation using SessionStart hooks. This can be configured in your repository’s .claude/settings.json file: CopyAsk AI{ "hooks": { "SessionStart": [ { "matcher": "startup", "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/scripts/install_pkgs.sh" } ] } ] } } Create the corresponding script at scripts/install_pkgs.sh: CopyAsk AI#!/bin/bash npm install pip install -r requirements.txt exit 0 Make it executable: chmod +x scripts/install_pkgs.sh ​Local vs remote execution By default, all hooks execute both locally and in remote (web) environments. To run a hook only in one environment, check the CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE environment variable in your hook script. CopyAsk AI#!/bin/bash # Example: Only run in remote environments if [ "$CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE" != "true" ]; then exit 0 fi npm install pip install -r requirements.txt ​Persisting environment variables SessionStart hooks can persist environment variables for subsequent bash commands by writing to the file specified in the CLAUDE_ENV_FILE environment variable. For details, see SessionStart hooks in the hooks reference. ​Network access and security ​Network policy ​GitHub proxy For security, all GitHub operations go through a dedicated proxy service that transparently handles all git interactions. Inside the sandbox, the git client authenticates using a custom-built scoped credential. This proxy: Manages GitHub authentication securely - the git client uses a scoped credential inside the sandbox, which the proxy verifies and translates to your actual GitHub authentication token Restricts git push operations to the current working branch for safety Enables seamless cloning, fetching, and PR operations while maintaining security boundaries ​Security proxy Environments run behind an HTTP/HTTPS network proxy for security and abuse prevention purposes. All outbound internet traffic passes through this proxy, which provides: Protection against malicious requests Rate limiting and abuse prevention Content filtering for enhanced security ​Access levels By default, network access is limited to allowlisted domains. You can configure custom network access, including disabling network access. ​Default allowed domains When using “Limited” network access, the following domains are allowed by default: ​Anthropic Services api.anthropic.com statsig.anthropic.com claude.ai ​Version Control github.com www.github.com api.github.com raw.githubusercontent.com objects.githubusercontent.com codeload.github.com avatars.githubusercontent.com camo.githubusercontent.com gist.github.com gitlab.com www.gitlab.com registry.gitlab.com bitbucket.org www.bitbucket.org api.bitbucket.org ​Container Registries registry-1.docker.io auth.docker.io index.docker.io hub.docker.com www.docker.com production.cloudflare.docker.com download.docker.com *.gcr.io ghcr.io mcr.microsoft.com *.data.mcr.microsoft.com ​Cloud Platforms cloud.google.com accounts.google.com gcloud.google.com *.googleapis.com storage.googleapis.com compute.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com azure.com portal.azure.com microsoft.com www.microsoft.com *.microsoftonline.com packages.microsoft.com dotnet.microsoft.com dot.net visualstudio.com dev.azure.com oracle.com www.oracle.com java.com www.java.com java.net www.java.net download.oracle.com yum.oracle.com ​Package Managers - JavaScript/Node registry.npmjs.org www.npmjs.com www.npmjs.org npmjs.com npmjs.org yarnpkg.com registry.yarnpkg.com ​Package Managers - Python pypi.org www.pypi.org files.pythonhosted.org pythonhosted.org test.pypi.org pypi.python.org pypa.io www.pypa.io ​Package Managers - Ruby rubygems.org www.rubygems.org api.rubygems.org index.rubygems.org ruby-lang.org www.ruby-lang.org rubyforge.org www.rubyforge.org rubyonrails.org www.rubyonrails.org rvm.io get.rvm.io ​Package Managers - Rust crates.io www.crates.io static.crates.io rustup.rs static.rust-lang.org www.rust-lang.org ​Package Managers - Go proxy.golang.org sum.golang.org index.golang.org golang.org www.golang.org goproxy.io pkg.go.dev ​Package Managers - JVM maven.org repo.maven.org central.maven.org repo1.maven.org jcenter.bintray.com gradle.org www.gradle.org services.gradle.org spring.io repo.spring.io ​Package Managers - Other Languages packagist.org (PHP Composer) www.packagist.org repo.packagist.org nuget.org (.NET NuGet) www.nuget.org api.nuget.org pub.dev (Dart/Flutter) api.pub.dev hex.pm (Elixir/Erlang) www.hex.pm cpan.org (Perl CPAN) www.cpan.org metacpan.org www.metacpan.org api.metacpan.org cocoapods.org (iOS/macOS) www.cocoapods.org cdn.cocoapods.org haskell.org www.haskell.org hackage.haskell.org swift.org www.swift.org ​Linux Distributions archive.ubuntu.com security.ubuntu.com ubuntu.com www.ubuntu.com *.ubuntu.com ppa.launchpad.net launchpad.net www.launchpad.net ​Development Tools & Platforms dl.k8s.io (Kubernetes) pkgs.k8s.io k8s.io www.k8s.io releases.hashicorp.com (HashiCorp) apt.releases.hashicorp.com rpm.releases.hashicorp.com archive.releases.hashicorp.com hashicorp.com www.hashicorp.com repo.anaconda.com (Anaconda/Conda) conda.anaconda.org anaconda.org www.anaconda.com anaconda.com continuum.io apache.org (Apache) www.apache.org archive.apache.org downloads.apache.org eclipse.org (Eclipse) www.eclipse.org download.eclipse.org nodejs.org (Node.js) www.nodejs.org ​Cloud Services & Monitoring statsig.com www.statsig.com api.statsig.com *.sentry.io ​Content Delivery & Mirrors *.sourceforge.net packagecloud.io *.packagecloud.io ​Schema & Configuration json-schema.org www.json-schema.org json.schemastore.org www.schemastore.org Domains marked with * indicate wildcard subdomain matching.

Credential protection: Sensitive credentials (such as git credentials or signing keys) are never inside the sandbox with Claude Code. Authentication is handled through a secure proxy using scoped credentials Secure analysis: Code is analyzed and modified within isolated VMs before creating PRs ​Pricing and rate limits Claude Code on the web shares rate limits with all other Claude and Claude Code usage within your account. Running multiple tasks in parallel will consume more rate limits proportionately. ​Limitations Repository authentication: You can only move sessions from web to local when you are authenticated to the same account Platform restrictions: Claude Code on the web only works with code hosted in GitHub. GitLab and other non-GitHub repositories cannot be used with cloud sessions ​Best practices Use Claude Code hooks: Configure sessionStart hooks to automate environment setup and dependency installation. Document requirements: Clearly specify dependencies and commands in your CLAUDE.md file. If you have an AGENTS.md file, you can source it in your CLAUDE.md using @AGENTS.md to maintain a single source of truth. ​Related resources Hooks configuration Settings reference Security Data usage Common workflowsClaude Code on desktop⌘I
